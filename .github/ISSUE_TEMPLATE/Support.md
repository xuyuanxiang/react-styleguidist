Developing and maintaining an open source project is a big effort. Styleguidist isn’t supported by any big company, and all the contributors are working on it in their free time. We need your help to make it sustainable.

There are two ways you can help:

1.  Help develop and maintain the project:

* Answer questions in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/issues) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-styleguidist).
* Review [pull requests](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/pulls).
* Fix bugs and add new features.
* Write articles and talk about Styleguidist on conferences and meetups (we’re always happy to review your texts and slides).

2.  Donate via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/styleguidist).
